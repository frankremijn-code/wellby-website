      <h1>Built by parents. Grounded in science.</h1>

      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Wellby Insights was founded to close a gap we kept seeing: parents want to do the right thing for their child's health — but the information they get is often contradictory, commercial, or poorly supported by science.</p>

        <p>At Wellby, we start from a different place. Our work is based on decades of research in pediatric immunology and immune–microbe interactions, including large longitudinal studies of infants and children. This research shows that how the immune system develops early in life matters — and these patterns can be measured.</p>
